    Student Alumni Mentorship Program (SAMP) is an unique initiative undertaken by the Studentsâ€™ Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur. Through this program students are connected with alumni who serve both as a guide and a source of inspiration for them. SAMP is launched with the goal of keeping the alumni connected to their alma mater as well as share their valuable experience with the current students.

             <b style="font-size:150%">Framework of Mentorship Program</b><br><br>
              Under this programme, we invite our alumni across the globe and from different fields to interact with the students and help them build their network and gain a new perspective on the possibilities open to them, after graduation.

    <br><br>

    With the students facing crossroads at every other turn and unable to choose what's best for them due to a lack of insight into how things would actually materialize with each road that they choose to take, it becomes crucial that they get advice from people who have faced the very same crossroads in their student life and the big bad competitive world beyond it.

    <br><br>

    The Alumni with their vast repository of personal experiences can help improve insight among students into so many diverse aspects of life which include academics, extracurriculars, the professional life after college or the general way of life. This is where the Student Alumni Mentorship Programme comes into the picture. 

    <br><br>

    It facilitates a medium where the student connects with an Alumnus from a field he has a profound interest in. He gives his preference of field, year and place while registering online and he is accordingly allotted a mentor based on a predefined code. In the process of learning the ropes in that particular field he takes home so much more from the guide, coach, supporter and motivator, he finds in his mentor.

    <b style="font-size:150%">Connecting with our Alumni</b><br><br>
    The Student Alumni Mentorship Programme is also an active step to keep the alumni in touch with all the happenings at IIT Kharagpur. The institute witnesses many changes from time to time. While some are quite evident like the construction and commencement of classes at the imposing new Nalanda Complex, a couple of years ago, others are a bit subtle like the formation of interesting new societies, changes in the General Championship standings and the intense heat surrounding it and all other bits of information that students know best. With an all year round interaction with the students, the Students Alumni Mentorship Programme ensures that the Alumni be in the know of the events as they occur and helps them relieve their own KGP days.

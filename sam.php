With an aim to bring together the students and the alumni, not just in the premises of the institute, but also regionally, Student Alumni Meets have been initiated. In collaboration with the regional chapters, SAMs bring together the students and the alumni under one roof and encourage interactive dialogue. Many such Student Alumni Meets have been conducted till now in various cities across India. Last year, Bangalore and Delhi witnessed such get togethers. SAMs play a very important role in strengthening the bond with alumni.

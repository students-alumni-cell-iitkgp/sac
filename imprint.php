  <p style="padding:20px;" class="z-depth-2">Ever since its inception, IIT Kharagpur has given its students outstanding academic resources, a brand to identify and reckon with, lasting friendships and countless memories over the years they have spent in its colossal campus. And along the same lines its alumni too have had a long and eventful history of giving back to the institute for all it has done in making them what they are today. The My Imprint Class Gift Program is yet another chapter to be added to the legacy that the Alumni leave behind.<br><br>
            The My Imprint Program follows a certain way of functioning. As the My Imprint Program says &#34;By the Students, for the Students&#34;, a My Imprint Class Gift Committee (MICGC) is set up each year which includes the incumbent and ex Vice Presidents, TSG and G-Secs, Students&#39; Alumni Cell along with the incumbent Hall Presidents of IIT Kharagpur. The MCIGC formulates 9 relevant options which are distributed equally under three slabs. One of the slabs decided by the number of registrations goes to final year students for open voting and the highest voted option is considered as the anticipated Senior Class Gift for that year. The Graduating Class Gift 2015 was campus benches among other exciting options that included a Water Fountain, an Art Gallery, a Grand Pillar Clock. These campus benches would serve as a memorial of the graduating batch for years to come.<br>
            <br>Over the years, the My Imprint Program has proven to be a very simple and efficient means to give back to the institute. As the graduates step into the alumni community, they leave behind a difference that they see not only physically but also in the joys of their KGPians enjoying the Class Gift and more importantly within their hearts that are now filled with the satisfaction of giving back. </p>

                <p style="padding:20px;" class="z-depth-2">Under this program, the graduating batches are given the chance to forfeit their caution deposits and the amount generated is partially utilized currently in making their Graduating Class Gift and partially goes towards endowment for future use albeit for students&#39; services only. It is an opportunity for the soon to be alumni to get a head-start in paying their tributes to their alma mater. Their gifts would impact the lives of their juniors for years to come. This challenge offers the senior class not only to make a gift but to leave behind an imprint. Other than the obvious visible benefits in the form of amenities and services, the Class Gift also contributes to the brand value of IIT Kgp, the same brand that propels them ahead of others in their professional and personal lives after college.</p> <hr>
